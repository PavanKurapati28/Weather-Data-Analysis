🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Report | Power BI (Multi-Page Report)

📌 Project Overview
This project is a detailed Power BI weather report based on historical daily weather data, focused on districts and mandals. The report spans five pages, each dedicated to specific weather elements such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It includes insightful visualizations to explore patterns, anomalies, seasonal variations, and inter-metric relationships over time.

All visualizations are built using Power BI’s native features, with no DAX measures—only calculated columns and default aggregations.

🗂 Dataset Description

Column	Description

District  : District where weather data was recorded
Mandal : 	Sub-region within the district
Date	: Date of weather observation
Rain (mm)	: Rainfall amount in millimeters
Min Temp (°C)	: Minimum daily temperature
Max Temp (°C)	: Maximum daily temperature
Min Humidity (%)	: Minimum daily humidity
Max Humidity (%)	: Maximum daily humidity
Min Wind Speed (Kmph)	: Minimum daily wind speed
Max Wind Speed (Kmph)	: Maximum daily wind speed
